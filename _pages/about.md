Hi, I am **Md. Mazharul Islam**.

I am a passionate cloud infrastructure engineer, cybersecurity specialist, and researcher with a solid foundation in computer science and a mission to build secure, scalable, and impactful digital systems. With professional experience spanning both industry and academia, I bring a unique blend of hands-on engineering, system design, and research-oriented thinking.

Currently, I serve as an **Assistant Manager (Cloud)** at Bangladesh Data Center Company Limited (BDCCL), where I manage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) deployments in one of the country’s most advanced Tier IV data centers. My responsibilities involve provisioning and automating cloud services, ensuring 99.995% system uptime, and implementing robust security and compliance standards. I take pride in making complex cloud environments efficient, resilient, and easy to maintain.

My journey began with a deep curiosity for how technology can improve lives. This led me to complete both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at North South University. My postgraduate research focused on blockchain-based privacy-preserving methods for fraud detection in health insurance systems—a field that sits at the intersection of cybersecurity, machine learning, and digital trust.

## 👨‍💻 Professional Experience

During my time at **EATL** as a Cybersecurity Instructor, I trained over 50 IT professionals through EC-Council’s hands-on iLabs, introducing them to secure configuration, threat analysis, and penetration testing techniques. Previously, at **One World Infotech**, I deployed two-factor authentication (2FA) systems in banking environments, integrated Checkmarx and CoreSecurity tools, and helped clients strengthen their overall cyber defense.

## 📚 Research & Academic Roles

As a **Research Assistant** at the IAR Lab, I collaborated on blockchain solutions to detect and prevent fraud in healthcare claims. We used smart contracts, anonymous credentials, and IPFS to build a decentralized yet privacy-conscious system. In my prior role at the **CPS-PMU Lab**, I developed a cyber-physical testbed simulating power grid communication using NS3, GridPACK, and HELICS, focusing on time synchronization, intrusion detection, and real-time simulation.

My teaching assistantship gave me the chance to support advanced coursework in simulation, database systems, and web technologies—reinforcing my understanding while mentoring peers.
